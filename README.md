Hello Everyone, 
My name is Ryan Biggins and I am a CS student at Boise State University. 

I am currently in CS  121, CS 153, and CS155. As you can see I really enjoy this field and wish to continue this onto my career.
This is my first time creating a git hub webpage and I think that it is really awesome.
